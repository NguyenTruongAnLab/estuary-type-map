The coastal typology contained in theses files is decribed in 
details in Dürr et al. (2011) and attributes geomorphological 
estuarine types to the entire global coastline.
 
It consists of a ribbon of grid cells at half-degree resolution, 
located along the entire global coastline at the exit (mouth) 
points of the global rivers. The typology was developed in a GIS 
framework, making it easy to use. The typology can be directly 
linked to other databases for continental river basins at the 
same scale, as it is linked to the simulated topological network 
(STN-30, version 6), as developed by the research group of 
Charles Vörösmarty. For the continents, there are a total of 
about 6200 cells. The 2 zip archives contain:

1) High resolution maps of the coastal typology both for river
	basins associated to each coastal cell as well as the 
	coastline itself only.

2) ArcView / ArcGIS shapefiles. The typology is contained in the 
	field (column) 'Fin_typ'. The Typology_coastline shapefile 
	contains only the coastline, the Typology_catchments 
	shapefile contains the coastal typology linked to the 
	STN-30 v.6 river basins from Vörösmarty et al. (2000a, b).
	The values of 'Fin-typ' correspond to:

0 - Endorheic or Glaciated
1 - Type I (Small deltas)
2 - Type II (Tidal systems)
3 - Type III (Lagoons)
4 - Type IV (Fjords and fjaerds)
5* - Non-filter - Type Va (Large Rivers) 
51* - Non-filter - Type Vb (Large Rivers with tidal deltas)
6 - Non-filter - Type VI (Karst)
7 - Non-filter - Type VII (Arheic)

* in the coastline-only, shapefile 5 and 51 are grouped to type V.
