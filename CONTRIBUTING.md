## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add New Estuaries

To add new estuaries to the dataset:

1. Ensure the estuary is documented in peer-reviewed scientific literature
2. Edit `scripts/process_estuary_data.py`
3. Add a new feature to the `estuaries` FeatureCollection with:
   - Accurate coordinates (longitude, latitude)
   - Proper geomorphological classification
   - Country/region information
   - Description with scientific basis
   - Area (kmÂ²) if available
   - Depth (m) if available
   - Associated river(s) if applicable

Example:
```python
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]},
    "properties": {
        "name": "Your Estuary Name",
        "type": "Delta",  # or Fjord, Lagoon, Ria, Coastal Plain, Bar-Built, Tectonic
        "country": "Country Name",
        "description": "Scientific description based on literature",
        "area_km2": 1000,
        "depth_m": 50,
        "river": "River Name"
    }
}
```

4. Run the data processing script: `python3 scripts/process_estuary_data.py`
5. Test the changes locally
6. Submit a pull request with:
   - Reference to scientific source
   - Justification for classification
   - Any relevant notes
