# üåä Global Estuary Type Map

An interactive web mapping framework for visualizing world estuaries classified by geomorphological shape types. This project uses open-access scientific datasets from D√ºrr et al. (2011), Baum et al. (2024), and optionally Athanasiou et al. (2024) for coastal characteristics.

## üî¨ Scientific Background

### What is an Estuary?

An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water where freshwater from rivers meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean. Estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, serving as critical habitats for diverse species and providing important ecosystem services.

### Geomorphological Classification

This project uses a geomorphological classification system based on the physical shape and formation processes of estuaries, as outlined in recent scientific literature. The classification helps understand:

- **Formation processes**: How the estuary was created (glaciation, river deposition, tectonic activity, etc.)
- **Physical characteristics**: Depth, width, sediment composition
- **Hydrodynamic behavior**: Mixing patterns, circulation, tidal influence
- **Ecological implications**: Habitat types, productivity patterns

## üìö Data Sources & Scientific Attribution

### Main Estuary Typology and Geometry

**D√ºrr, H.H., Laruelle, G.G., van Kempen, C.M., Slomp, C.P., Meybeck, M., & Middelkoop, H. (2011)**  
*Worldwide typology of nearshore coastal systems: defining the estuarine filter of river inputs to the oceans.*  
**Estuaries and Coasts**, 34(3), 441-458.  
DOI: [10.1007/s12237-011-9381-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-011-9381-y)

This comprehensive study provides the global framework for classifying estuaries based on their geomorphological characteristics. The dataset includes ~6,200 coastal cells with estuary typology linked to river basins.

### Coastal Attributes (Land Use, Slope, Elevation) ‚Äî Optional Enrichment

**Athanasiou, P., van Dongeren, A., Giardino, A., Vousdoukas, M., Ranasinghe, R., & Kwadijk, J. (2024)**  
*Global Coastal Characteristics (GCC) Database.*  
DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.8200199](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8200199)

Because the GCC_geophysical.csv file is >200MB, it is **not included** in this repository.  
To use GCC data enrichment:
1. Download the latest GCC geophysical CSV from [Zenodo GCC Download](https://zenodo.org/records/11072020/files/GCC_geophysical.csv?download=1)
2. Place it in `data/GCC-Panagiotis-Athanasiou_2024/`
3. The processing pipeline can be extended to extract and join coastal attributes for estuary polygons

### Large Structural Estuaries (Validation/Enrichment)

**Baum, M.J., Sch√ºttrumpf, H., & Siemes, R.W. (2024)**  
*Large structural estuaries: Their global distribution and morphology.*  
**Geomorphology**, supplementary data.

This dataset provides morphometric data (width, length, geomorphotype) for 271 large embayments globally, used to enrich the primary D√ºrr dataset.

### Validation and Context

_Note: Laruelle et al. (2025) "A global classification of estuaries based on their geomorphological characteristics" (Estuaries and Coasts) is used solely for validation and global area statistics. No shape, polygon, or direct attribute data is sourced from this study._

### Data Processing

The Python script `scripts/process_estuary_data.py` processes real estuary data from open-access sources:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install geopandas pandas pyproj

# Process data
python3 scripts/process_estuary_data.py
```

This script:
1. Reads D√ºrr et al. (2011) shapefile with ~6,200 estuary catchments
2. Filters and selects representative estuaries for visualization
3. Enriches with Baum et al. (2024) morphometry data where available
3. Generates a GeoJSON file for web mapping with complete provenance metadata
4. Validates data structure and completeness

All data sources are properly attributed with DOIs and citations in the output GeoJSON.
