# üåä Global Estuary Type Map

An interactive web mapping framework for visualizing world estuaries classified by geomorphological shape types. This project uses the global datasets from Laruelle et al. (2024, Estuaries and Coasts) as the primary scientific source.

  - Name and location
  - Geomorphological classification

## üî¨ Scientific Background

### What is an Estuary?

An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water where freshwater from rivers meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean. Estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, serving as critical habitats for diverse species and providing important ecosystem services.

### Geomorphological Classification

This project uses a geomorphological classification system based on the physical shape and formation processes of estuaries, as outlined in recent scientific literature. The classification helps understand:

- **Formation processes**: How the estuary was created (glaciation, river deposition, tectonic activity, etc.)
- **Physical characteristics**: Depth, width, sediment composition
- **Hydrodynamic behavior**: Mixing patterns, circulation, tidal influence
- **Ecological implications**: Habitat types, productivity patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Mapping Library**: [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) v1.9.4
- **Data Format**: GeoJSON
- **Data Processing**: Python 3.x
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static site)
- **Base Map**: OpenStreetMap tiles

### Data Processing

The Python script `scripts/process_estuary_data.py` automates the processing of estuary data:

```bash
python3 scripts/process_estuary_data.py
```

This script:
1. Processes raw estuary data from scientific sources
2. Classifies estuaries by geomorphological type
3. Generates a GeoJSON file for web mapping
4. Validates data structure and completeness

### Map Features Implementation

**Filtering System**:
- Dynamic checkboxes for each estuary type
- "All Types" master filter
- Real-time marker updates without page reload

**Visual Design**:
- Color-coded markers by estuary type
- Custom popup styling with detailed information
